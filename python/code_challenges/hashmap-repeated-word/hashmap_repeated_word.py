def repeated_word(phrase):
    # In Plain English:
    # Split phrase into individual words.
    # Check if hash table contains next word.
    # If word already in hash table, return word.
    # If not, put word in hash table
    # Go to next word and check if in hash table.

    # Algorithm:
    # 1. Split phrase
    # 2. Loop over words
    # 2a. Check hash table for word
    # 2b. If true, return word
    # 2c. If not, add word to table
